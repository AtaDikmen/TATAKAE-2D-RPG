<h3 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Excited to share my new game, Tatakae!</h3>

# Introduction
Tatakae is a 2D RPG game that I developed with my personal efforts, research, and support from various resources such as Udemy courses. It's got cool 2D graphics, a modular skill tree, a stat system, combat mechanics, crafting, inventory system, save&load system, a bunch of different enemies, and challenging boss battles. The details in the game show off both my own creativity and what I've learned from those courses.

I've meticulously worked to provide players with a rich gaming experience and engaging combat mechanics to ensure they won't get bored. I hope you enjoy playing my game! Happy gaming to everyone!
